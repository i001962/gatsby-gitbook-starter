# 2.4. How can I use Cryptowerk Horizon?
Cryptowerk Horizon is a cloud-based solution that can easily be integrated into any existing enterprise system or application. By connecting your existing system to Cryptowerk Horizon, hashes of data will be sent to Cryptowerk. Cryptowerk Horizon will return you a so called “Seal” that makes your data tamper-proof and can be used for auditing processes.

# 2.5. What do I need to access Cryptowerk’s service
Cryptowerk Horizon is easy and simple to implement in any system or application, and does not interfere with existing processes. There are no specific prerequisites from your end required. For any account questions, please contact: support@cryptowerk.com.

# 2.6. Does Cryptowerk see or store my data?
Cryptowerk never receives, sees or stores your or your customer’s data, documents, or digital assets. You can store and maintain your data wherever you want, including PC’s, in-house servers, network storage, document repositories, or cloud storage systems.

# 2.7. Is Cryptowerk’s technology compliant with EU legislation/GDPR/GdpdU/ HIPAA/Sarbanes-Oxley?
Because Cryptowerk never sees the customer’s data or documents, Cryptowerk Horizon complies with all data privacy laws. The data never leaves the customer’s possession or control. It’s up to the customer to “hash locally” or via a web-based hashing tool. That decision is out of Cryptowerk’s control. Cryptowerk’s technology is GDPR compliant, because it has a so-called “killer switch”. If a user deletes a Seal, the hash link to the hash of the original data in the blockchain is disconnected. Hence, Cryptowerk’s technology supports the “right to be forgotten”.

# 2.8. Is Cryptowerk’s technology compliant with the US Export Control Law? Am I “exporting” by using Cryptowerk Horizon?
Because you don’t transmit any digital assets (data, documents, images, software, etc.) to the Cryptowerk Horizon API, you aren’t “exporting” them. You are only transmitting hashes, and hashes do not have underlying value.
