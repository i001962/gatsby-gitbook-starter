Cryptowerk Horizon API (SealAPI) is a solution to verify the authenticity of data at massive scale using blockchains.
With the help of Cryptowerk Horizon API you can prove the existence of a document or any other kind of data at
a certain time without needing a trusted third party. This API supports high data volumes and reduces the cost
of using a public blockchain. You never submit original data to Cryptowerk Horizon API, only hashes of data.
This provides the highest possible security, efficiency, and ease of implementation.
